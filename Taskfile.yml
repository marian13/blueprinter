  # NOTE: `docker run` automatically builds image if is not built yet.
  #
  # NOTE:
  #   `task install` is executed during image build process.
  #   But it is impossible to have access to the volumes during the image build process.
  #   So `Gemfile` changes are NOT persisted inside `Gemfile.lock`.
  #   That is why `task install` is executed for the second time by `docker compose run` since it has access to volumes.
  #   This add more minutes to `task docker:build`, but eliminates the time required to debug unmodified `Gemfile.lock` issues.
  #
  # NOTE:
  #   `docker compose up` builds all images listed in the `docker-compose.yml` and then starts all containers.
  #   This is too resource heavy most of the time, that is `docker compose run` and Docker Compose `depends_on` are used instead.
